## Read.ai Demo Summary (MEDDIC) - 2025-12-19

**Confidence: Warm**

**Meeting Attendees:**
  • John Smith <john@acme.com> [External (Meeting Owner)]
    - Spoke ~234 words
    - Sample: "We need a better way to review our video content with clients. Our current process is really inefficient."
  • Mary Johnson <mary@acme.com> [External]
    - Spoke ~187 words
    - Sample: "This looks really useful for our design team. We've been struggling with feedback loops."
  • Steve Chen <steve@acme.com> [External]
    - Spoke ~92 words
    - Sample: "What's the pricing for teams of our size?"
  • Sales Rep <rep@govisually.com> [Internal]
    - Spoke ~456 words
    - Sample: "Great! Let me show you how our platform handles video reviews and client collaboration."

**Metrics:**
Looking to reduce review cycles from 3 days to same-day. Current process wastes 15-20 hours per week across team.

**Economic buyer:**
John Smith (VP of Creative Operations) has budget authority. Final approval needed from CFO for contracts over $50k.

**Decision criteria:**
- Must integrate with existing tools (ClickUp, Smartsheet)
- Video review capabilities are critical
- Client-facing collaboration features
- ROI justification within 6 months

**Decision process:**
Trial with design team (2 weeks) → Internal review → CFO approval → Purchase decision. Timeline: 4-6 weeks.

**Identified pain:**
- Email/spreadsheet review process is chaotic and error-prone
- Video editing feedback loops are especially painful with external clients
- Lost files and version control issues
- Team frustration with context switching

**Champion:**
Mary Johnson (Design Team Lead) is very enthusiastic and willing to drive internal adoption.

**Competition:**
Currently using ClickUp + Smartsheet + email. Evaluated Frame.io but found it too expensive.

**Next steps:**
1. Sales Rep to send trial access by EOD
2. John to schedule internal team kickoff meeting
3. Mary to run video review pilot with 2 client projects
4. Follow-up meeting in 2 weeks to review progress

**Risks:**
Budget sensitivity - need to stay under $5k/month. CFO approval might be delayed if timing coincides with Q1 planning.
